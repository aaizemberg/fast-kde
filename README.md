# Fast & Accurate Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation

Methods and benchmarks for fast, approximate Gaussian kernel density estimation.

This repo contains code and benchmark scripts for the VIS 2021 Short Paper Submission "Fast & Accurate Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation". The scripts are written in JavaScript and require node.js version 12 or higher to run.

## Running Instructions

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npm run benchmarks` to run benchmarks.
3. Wait until the benchmarks complete...

Benchmark result datasets will be written to the `results` directory as JSON files.
